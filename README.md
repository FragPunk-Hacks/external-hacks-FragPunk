# FragPunk External Hacks ‚Äì Undetected ESP & Silent Aimbot Tool

FragPunk thrives on reaction speed and situational awareness, but external hacks can give you a **hidden advantage** without modifying the game files directly. The **FragPunk External Hacks Tool** runs outside the game client, making it **safer and harder to detect** while still providing powerful features like ESP overlays, silent aimbot, and loot filtering.

---

## üîé Overview

Unlike internal injections, **external hacks operate independently** of the FragPunk process. This means fewer detection risks, smooth overlay rendering, and easier updates after patches. You gain the benefits of **aim assist, radar awareness, and item tracking** with minimal performance impact.

## üéØ Key Features

* **Silent Aimbot** ‚Äì Bullets land on target without visible aim snapping.
* **ESP Overlay** ‚Äì Clean wall vision for enemies, loot, and traps.
* **Drop Radar** ‚Äì Highlight rare items and power-ups instantly.
* **External Execution** ‚Äì Runs outside the game, avoiding memory tampering.
* **Config Profiles** ‚Äì Save custom setups for different maps or playstyles.

\[!NOTE]
Because these are external hacks, overlays may need calibration on first use.
